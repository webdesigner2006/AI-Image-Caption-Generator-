## üöÄ How to Run It Locally

Want to try it yourself? It's super easy to get started.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/image_captioning.git](https://github.com/your-username/image_captioning.git)
    cd image_captioning
    ```

2.  **Set up a Python environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: The first time you run it, the app will download the AI model (about 1.7GB), so it might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection. After that, it's cached!*

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

Now you can upload your own images and see what the AI thinks!
